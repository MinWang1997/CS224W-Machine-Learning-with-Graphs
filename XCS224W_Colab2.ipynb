From the dropdown, select `None` as the `hardware accelerator`.\n","- When working with PyTorch and Neural Network models, understanding the shapes of different tensors, especially the input and output tensors is incredibly helpful.\n","- When training models, it is helpful to start by only running 1 epoch or even just a couple of batch iterations. This way you can check that all your tensor shapes and logic match up, while also tracking expected behavior, such as a decreasing training loss.
